# IMPORTANT-when iota-subscript (0345) is uppercased or titlecased,
#  the result will be incorrect unless the iota-subscript is moved to the end
#  of any sequence of combining marks. Otherwise, the accents will go on the capital iota.
#  This process can be achieved by first transforming the text to NFC before casing.
#  E.g. <alpha><iota_subscript><acute> is uppercased to <ALPHA><acute><IOTA>

# The following cases are already in the UnicodeData file, so are only commented here.

# 0345; 0345; 0345; 0399; # COMBINING GREEK YPOGEGRAMMENI

# All letters with YPOGEGRAMMENI (iota-subscript) or PROSGEGRAMMENI (iota adscript)
# have special uppercases.
# Note: characters with PROSGEGRAMMENI are actually titlecase, not uppercase!
