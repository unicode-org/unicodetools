This directory contains early versions of some of the data files
for the Unicode Character Database, in preparation for
the beta review for Version 7.0.0 of the Unicode
Standard. At this date, these files are very incomplete,
and are posted primarily to provide preliminary information
about the Version 7.0.0 repertoire and to document character
property decisions made by the UTC prior to the start of
beta review.

Note that derived and extracted data files are produced
by running a number of scripts and then populating
the data directory with the results. There is no guarantee
that at any given time all of the derived and extracted
data files are completely in synch with the primary
data files, because the scripts for derived and extracted
data files are only run occasionally, as warranted, whereas
spot fixes for data files such as UnicodeData.txt may
be posted more frequently. Use care when using the extracted
or derived data files during the beta review period, and
do not bother to report minor discrepancies in synchronization,
unless there appears to be a systematic issue with how
a particular derivation or extraction has been generated.

Do *NOT* attempt to make use of this data in any
Unicode-based product.


See the beta notice page:

for details about the beta review period and how to
provide feedback.
