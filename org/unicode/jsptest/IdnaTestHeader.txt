# Idna Test Suite [WORKING DRAFT]
#
# Contains test cases for verifying UTS46 conformance. For more information,
# see http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr46/
#
# FORMAT:
#
# This file is in UTF8, with certain characters escaped using the \uXXXX convention where they
# could otherwise have a confusing display. For example, this includes characters of 
# Default ignorable characters; General Categories C and Z; and Bidi categories R, AL, AN.
# Columns (c1, c2,...) are separated by semicolons.
# Leading and trailing spaces and tabs in each column are ignored.
# Comments are indicated with hash marks.
#
#  Column 1: type - T for transitional, N for nontransitional, B for both
#  Column 2: source - the source string to be tested
#  Column 3: toUnicode - the result of applying toUnicode to the source, using the specified type
#  Column 4: toASCII - the result of applying toASCII to the source, using nontransitional
#
# If the value of toUnicode or toASCII is the same as source, the column will be blank.
#
# An error in toUnicode or toASCII is indicated by a value in square brackets, such as "[B5 B6]".
# In such a case, the contents is a list of error codes based on the step numbers in UTS46 and IDNA2008,
# with the following formats:
#
#   Pn for Section 4 Processing step n
#   Vn for 4.1 Validity Criteria step n
#   An for 4.2 ToASCII step n
#   Bn for Bidi (in IDNA2008)
#   Cn for ContextJ (in IDNA2008)
#
# However, these particular error codes are only informative;
# the important feature is whether or not there is an error.
#
# CONFORMANCE:
#
# To test for conformance to UTS46, an implementation must first perform the toASCII and to Unicode operations
# on the source string, with the indicated type. Implementations may be more strict than UTS46;
# thus they may have errors where the file indicates results. Moreover, the error codes in the file
# are informative; implementations need only record that there is an error: they need not reproduce
# those codes. Thus to then verify conformance for the toASCII and toUnicode columns:
#
# - If the file indicates an error, the implementation must also have an error.
# - If the file does not indicate an error, then the implementation must either have an error, 
#   or must have a matching result.
