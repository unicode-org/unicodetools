# Special Casing
#
# This file is a supplement to the UnicodeData.txt file. It does not define any
# properties, but rather provides additional information about the casing of
# Unicode characters, for situations when casing incurs a change in string length
# or is dependent on context or locale. For compatibility, the UnicodeData.txt
# file only contains simple case mappings for characters where they are one-to-one
# and independent of context and language. The data in this file, combined with
# the simple case mappings in UnicodeData.txt, defines the full case mappings
# Lowercase_Mapping (lc), Titlecase_Mapping (tc), and Uppercase_Mapping (uc).
#
# Note that the preferred mechanism for defining tailored casing operations is
# the Unicode Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR). For more information, see the
# discussion of case mappings and case algorithms in the Unicode Standard.
#
# All code points not listed in this file that do not have a simple case mappings
# in UnicodeData.txt map to themselves.

# Format
# ================================================================================
# The entries in this file are in the following machine-readable format:
#
# <code>; <lower>; <title>; <upper>; (<condition_list>;)? # <comment>
#
# <code>, <lower>, <title>, and <upper> provide the respective full case mappings
# of <code>, expressed as character values in hex. If there is more than one character,
# they are separated by spaces. Other than as used to separate elements, spaces are
# to be ignored.
#
# The <condition_list> is optional. Where present, it consists of one or more language IDs
# or casing contexts, separated by spaces. In these conditions:
# - A condition list overrides the normal behavior if all of the listed conditions are true.
# - The casing context is always the context of the characters in the original string,
#   NOT in the resulting string.
# - Case distinctions in the condition list are not significant.
# - Conditions preceded by "Not_" represent the negation of the condition.
# The condition list is not represented in the UCD as a formal property.
#
# A language ID is defined by BCP 47, with '-' and '_' treated equivalently.
#
# A casing context for a character is defined by Section 3.13 Default Case Algorithms
# of The Unicode Standard.
#
# Parsers of this file must be prepared to deal with future additions to this format:
#  * Additional contexts
#  * Additional fields
