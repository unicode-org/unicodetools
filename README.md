# Unicode Tools

This is a collection of tools by and for Unicode Character Database (UCD)
maintainers for the production and vetting of data files for the UCD and
other Unicode specs such as UCA, emoji, idna, and security.

Do not use the Unicode data files in this repo for production.
Do use the data files posted publicly on unicode.org.

There is some documentation for these tools at
https://sites.google.com/site/unicodetools/home

The documentation still refers to the previous Subversion repository.
This GitHub repo reflects the svn repo up to r1566,
plus a few snapshots up to r1830. (Donâ€™t ask.)
