# Unicode Tools

This is a collection of tools by and for Unicode Character Database (UCD)
maintainers for the production and vetting of data files for the UCD and
other Unicode specs such as UCA.

Do not use the Unicode data files in this repo for production.
Do use the data files posted publicly on unicode.org.

There is some documentation for these tools in this repo, in the [docs folder](./docs/).

Some of the documentation still refers to the previous Subversion repository.
This GitHub repo reflects the svn repo up to r1566,
plus a few snapshots up to r1830. (Don’t ask.)

### Bug reports

For feedback on the Unicode Standard and bug reports against the Unicode Character Database,
use the Unicode Contact Form: https://www.unicode.org/reporting.html

Do not use the GitHub Issues feature in this repo for those.
The tools maintainers use GH issues for issues with the code in this repo.
