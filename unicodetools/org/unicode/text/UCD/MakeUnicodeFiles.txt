File: extra/ScriptNfkc
Property: SPECIAL
# Shows where the script values of a character don't agree with the script values of the NFKD form (skipping Common and Inherited)
#

File: extracted/DerivedName
#
# This file lists the values of the Name property.
# This property is specified by the derivation documented in
# Section 4.8 of the Unicode Standard, Version 11.0,
# based on the Name field in UnicodeData.txt,
# the Jamo_Short_Name property in Jamo.txt,
# and a specified list of pattern strings used to derive names
# for certain ranges of characters from their code points.
# This file provides a full listing of the derived values
# so that implementations do not have to properly
# code that derivation.
#
# The format is two fields separated by a semicolon.
# Field 0: Unicode code point value or range of code point values
# Field 1: Name property value or pattern.
#
# • Values containing a * character are patterns which
#   use the placeholder * in place of the code point in hex.
#   In such cases, the name property value for any code point in Field 0
#   is formed by replacing the '*' with that code point value
#   in the usual 4- to 6-digit hexadecimal format.
#
#   UAX #42 and its data files use a similar convention,
#   except that the metacharacter there is '#'.
#
#   For example, the Name property value of U+4E12,
#   generated from the pattern string "CJK UNIFIED IDEOGRAPH-*",
#   is CJK UNIFIED IDEOGRAPH-4E12.
#   Similarly, the Name property value of U+2F89F, 
#   generated from the pattern string "CJK COMPATIBILITY IDEOGRAPH-*",
#   is CJK COMPATIBILITY IDEOGRAPH-2F89F.

File: ScriptExtensions
#
# The Script_Extensions property indicates which characters are commonly used
# with more than one script, but with a limited number of scripts.
# For each code point, there is one or more property values.  Each such value is a Script property value.
# For more information, see:
#   UAX #24, Unicode Script Property: http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr24/
#     Especially the sections:
#       http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr24/#Assignment_Script_Values
#       http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr24/#Assignment_ScriptX_Values
#
# Each Script_Extensions value in this file consists of a set
# of one or more abbreviated Script property values. The ordering of the
# values in that set is not material, but for stability in presentation
# it is given here as alphabetical.
#
# The Script_Extensions values are presented in sorted order in the file.
# They are sorted first by the number of Script property values in their sets,
# and then alphabetically by first differing Script property value.
#
# Following each distinct Script_Extensions value is the list of code
# points associated with that value, listed in code point order.
# 
# All code points not explicitly listed for Script_Extensions
# have as their value the corresponding Script property value

#
#  All block ranges start with a value where (cp MOD 16) = 0,
#  and end with a value where (cp MOD 16) = 15. In other words,
#  the last hexadecimal digit of the start of range is ...0 
#  and the last hexadecimal digit of the end of range is ...F.
#  This constraint on block ranges guarantees that allocations
#  are done in terms of whole columns, and that code chart display
#  never involves splitting columns in the charts.
#
#  All code points not explicitly listed for Block
#  have the value No_Block.

File:   BidiTest
#
# This file provides a conformance test for UBA (Unicode Bidi Algorithm) implementations.
# It is designed to be reasonably compact, and yet provide a thorough test of all cases up to
# a given limit (currently 4). Additionally, it contains some longer cases useful for testing
# some common pitfalls of UBA implementations.
#
# Note that for the test cases in this file, it is assumed that no bidi
# paired brackets exist in the input that would affect the resolved levels
# or reordering. For test cases with bidi paired brackets and other
# character-code specific test cases, refer to BidiCharacterTest.txt.
# Implementations are expected to correctly cover all test cases in both
# test files.
#
# The test cases in this file are further limited in the following ways:
#
# - The Bidi_Class B (Paragraph_Separator) only appears as the last
#   character in a sequence. Thus, each sequence is assumed to consist of
#   only one paragraph. Implementations may need extra testing for rule P1
#   of the UBA.
#
# - For the application of rules L1 and L2, it is assumed that all the
#   characters in the input would be rendered on a single line, with no line
#   breaks.
#
# - Implementation of rules L3 and L4 is platform- and character-specific
#   and test cases for it are not provided in this data file.
#
#
# Format:
#
# All tokens may be separated by whitespaces (space or tab). There are three kinds of lines:
# Levels, Reorder, and data.
#
# A Levels line indicates that all following data lines, up to the next Levels line,
# have the same resulting ordering levels. It has the following format:
#
# @Levels: <levels>
#
#    <levels> =     An ordered space-delimited list of numbers indicating the resulting levels
#                   for each input property value. The UBA does not assign levels to certain values;
#                   those are indicated with an x. See the note below.
# Examples:
#   @Levels:    1 0
#   @Levels:    x 1 x 2
#
# A Reorder line indicates that all following data lines, up to the next Reorder line,
# have the same resulting reordering. It has the following format:
#
# @Reorder: <ordering>
#
#    <ordering> =   An ordered space-delimited list of numbers indicating the resulting
#                   visual ordering from left to right. The numbers are zero-based, and
#                   are indexes into the input string. Items with a level of x are skipped.
#                   Thus "1 0" indicates what would happen with input of "L R" and an RTL
#                   paragraph direction.
# Example:
#   @Reorder:    1 0
#   @Reorder:    3 1
#
# A data line has the following format:

# <input> ; <bitset>

#   <input>  =      An ordered list of BIDI property values
#   <bitset> =      A hex bitset for paragraph levels (P): 1 = auto-LTR, 2 = LTR, 4 = RTL
#                   Auto-LTR (standard BIDI) uses the first L/R/AL character, and is LTR if none is found.
# Example:
#    L LRE R R; 7
#    L LRE R AL; 7
#
# Any other line starting with @ is to be ignored (this allows some degree of forward compatibility).
#
# Usage:
#
# - If the implementation API allows a list of bidi property values as input:
#
#   For each of the paragraph levels in the bitset:
#     Find the levels in each line, and compare that to the last @Levels values.
#       If they are different, the test fails.
#     Reorder the elements, and compare to the @Reorder values.
#       If they are different, the test fails.
#
# - If the implementation allows for a character string as input,
#   randomly pick characters from those with the same Bidi_Class values,
#   and test the reordering as above.
#
# Note that the UBA doesn't specify the output level or order of certain characters,
# such as LRO. These are omitted from the reordered output. Thus the following two
# input lines have the same result (0), since the LRE (item 1) is omitted on the second line.
#
#   L; 7
#   L LRE; 7
