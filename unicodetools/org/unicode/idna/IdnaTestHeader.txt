# Contains test cases for verifying UTS46 conformance. For more information,

#
# FORMAT:
#
# This file is in UTF8, with certain characters escaped using the \uXXXX or \x{XXXX}
# convention where they could otherwise have a confusing display.
# These characters include:
# 
# - General Categories C, Z, and M
# - Default ignorable characters
# - Bidi categories R, AL, AN
# 
# Columns (c1, c2,...) are separated by semicolons.
# Leading and trailing spaces and tabs in each column are ignored.
# Comments are indicated with hash marks.
#
#  Column 1: type -      T for transitional, N for nontransitional, B for both
#  Column 2: source -    The source string to be tested
#  Column 3: toUnicode - The result of applying toUnicode to the source, using nontransitional. 
#                        A blank value means the same as the source value.
#  Column 4: toASCII -   The result of applying toASCII to the source, using the specified type: T, N, or B.
#                        A blank value means the same as the toUnicode value.
#  Column 5: NV8 -       Present if the toUnicode value would not be a valid domain name under IDNA2008.
#                        Not a normative field.
#
# If the value of toUnicode is the same as source, the column will be blank.
# The line comments currently show visible characters that have been escaped 
# (after removing default-ignorables and controls, except for whitespace)
#
# The test is performed with the following flag settings:
#
# VerifyDnsLength:   true
# CheckHyphens:      true
# CheckBidi:         true
# CheckJoiners:      true
# UseSTD3ASCIIRules: true
#
# An error in toUnicode or toASCII is indicated by a value in square brackets, such as "[B5 B6]".
# In such a case, the contents is a list of error codes based on the step numbers in UTS46 and IDNA2008,
# with the following formats:
#
#   Pn for Section 4 Processing step n
#   Vn for 4.1 Validity Criteria step n
#   An for 4.2 ToASCII step n
#   Bn for Bidi (in IDNA2008)
#   Cn for ContextJ (in IDNA2008)
#
# However, these particular error codes are only informative;
# the important feature is whether or not there is an error.
#
# CONFORMANCE:
#
# To test for conformance to UTS46, an implementation must first perform the toASCII and to Unicode operations
# on the source string, with the indicated type. Implementations may be more strict than UTS46;
# thus they may have errors where the file indicates results. In particular, an implementation conformant to 
# IDNA2008 would disallow the input for lines marked with NV8.
#
# Moreover, the error codes in the file are informative; implementations need only record that there is an error:
# they need not reproduce those codes. Thus to then verify conformance for the toASCII and toUnicode columns:
#
# - If the file indicates an error, the implementation must also have an error.
# - If the file does not indicate an error, then the implementation must either have an error, 
#   or must have a matching result.
