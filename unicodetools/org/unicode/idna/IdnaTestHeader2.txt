# Test cases for verifying UTS #46 conformance.
#
# FORMAT:
#
# This file is in UTF-8, where characters may be escaped using the \uXXXX or \x{XXXX}
# convention where they could otherwise have a confusing display.
# These characters include control codes and combining marks.
#
# Columns (c1, c2,...) are separated by semicolons.
# Leading and trailing spaces and tabs in each column are ignored.
# Comments are indicated with hash marks.
#
# Column 1: source -          The source string to be tested
# Column 2: toUnicode -       The result of applying toUnicode to the source,
#                             with Transitional_Processing=false.
#                             A blank value means the same as the source value.
# Column 3: toUnicodeStatus - A set of status codes, each corresponding to a particular test.
#                             A blank value means [] (no errors).
# Column 4: toAsciiN -        The result of applying toASCII to the source,
#                             with Transitional_Processing=false.
#                             A blank value means the same as the toUnicode value.
# Column 5: toAsciiNStatus -  A set of status codes, each corresponding to a particular test.
#                             A blank value means the same as the toUnicodeStatus value.
#                             An explicit [] means no errors.
# Column 6: toAsciiT -        The result of applying toASCII to the source,
#                             with Transitional_Processing=true.
#                             A blank value means the same as the toAsciiN value.
# Column 7: toAsciiTStatus -  A set of status codes, each corresponding to a particular test.
#                             A blank value means the same as the toAsciiNStatus value.
#                             An explicit [] means no errors.
#
# The line comments currently show visible characters that have been escaped.
#
# CONFORMANCE:
#
# To test for conformance to UTS #46, an implementation will perform the toUnicode, toAsciiN, and
# toAsciiT operations on the source string, then verify the resulting strings and relevant status
# values.
#
# If the implementation converts illegal code points into U+FFFD (as per
# https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr46/#Processing) then the string comparisons need to
# account for that by treating U+FFFD in the actual value as a wildcard when comparing to the
# expected value in the test file.
#
# A status in toUnicode, toAsciiN or toAsciiT is indicated by a value in square brackets,
# such as "[B5 B6]". In such a case, the contents is a list of status codes based on the step
# numbers in UTS #46 and IDNA2008, with the following formats.
#
#   Pn for Section 4 Processing step n
#   Vn for 4.1 Validity Criteria step n
#   U1 for UseSTD3ASCIIRules
#   An for 4.2 ToASCII step n
#   Bn for Bidi (in IDNA2008)
#   Cn for ContextJ (in IDNA2008)
#   Xn for toUnicode issues (see below)
#
# Thus C1 = Appendix A.1. ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER, and C2 = Appendix A.2. ZERO WIDTH JOINER.
# (The CONTEXTO tests are optional for client software, and not tested here.)
#
# Implementations that allow values of particular input flags to be false would ignore
# the corresponding status codes listed in the table below when testing for errors.
#
# VerifyDnsLength:   P4
# CheckHyphens:      V2, V3
# CheckBidi:         V8
# CheckJoiners:      V7
# UseSTD3ASCIIRules: U1
#
# Implementations may be more strict than the default settings for UTS #46.
# In particular, an implementation conformant to IDNA2008 would disallow the input for lines
# marked with NV8.
#
# Implementations need only record that there is an error: they need not reproduce the
# precise status codes (after removing the ignored status values).
#
# Compatibility errors
#
# The special error codes X3 and X4_2 are now returned where a toASCII error code
# was formerly being generated in toUnicode due to an empty label.
#
# A3 was being generated in the following cases (in addition to its normal usage).
#   • an empty label in toUnicode. In this case, it is replaced by X3.
#
# A4_2 was being generated in the following case (in addition to its normal usage).
#   • an empty label in V8 (CheckBidi). In this case, it is being replaced by X4_2.
