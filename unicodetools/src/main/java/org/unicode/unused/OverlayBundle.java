/**
 * A ResourceBundle that overlays one hierarchy atop another.  This is
 * best explained by example.  Suppose one wants to use the
 * resource hiararchy (in JDK 1.2 and 1.3, but not 1.4) at 
 * "java.text.resources.LocaleElements", but one wants to use
 * a modified version of the "NumberPatterns" resource in the
 * fr_FR locale.  One way to do this is to add special case code
 * to the lookup operation to check for fr_FR and the key
 * "NumberPatterns", and in that case, load up custom data.  However,
 * this becomes unwieldy and places some information about the
 * effective resource hierarchy into the code.
 *
 * The OverlayBundle solves this problem by layering another
 * hierarchy, e.g, "com.acme.resources.LocaleElements", on top of a
 * base hierarchy.  When a resource is requested, it is first sought
 * in the overlay hierarchy, and if not found there, it is sought in
 * the base hierarchy.  Multiple overlays are supported, but in
 * practice one is usually sufficient.
 * 
 * The OverlayBundle also addresses the problem of country-oriented
 * data.  To specify the default data for a language, one just sets
 * the language resource bundle data.  However, specifying the default
 * data for a country using the standard ResourceBundle mechanism is
 * impossible.  The OverlayBundle recognizes "wildcard" locales with
 * the special language code "xx".  When looking up data for a locale
 * with a non-empty country, if an exact locale match cannot be found,
 * the OverlayBundle looks for data in the locale xx_YY, where YY is
 * the country being sought.  This effectively adds another entry in
 * the fallback sequence for a locale aa_BB: aa_BB, xx_BB, aa, root.
 * Wildcard locales are not implemented for the base hierarchy, only
 * for overlays.
 *
 * The OverlayBundle is implemented as an array of n ResourceBundle
 * base names.  The base names are searched from 0 to n-1.  Base name
 * n-1 is special; it is the base hierarchy.  This should be a
 * well-populated hierarchy with most of the default data, typically,
 * the icu or sun core hierarchies.  The base hierarchy is
 * treated differently from the overlays above it.  It does not get
 * wildcard resolution, and the getKeys() framework method is
 * delegated to the base hierarchy bundle.
 *
 * Usage: Instantiate an OverlayBundle directly (not via a factory
 * method as in ResourceBundle).  Instead of specifying a single base
 * name, pass it an array of 2 or more base names.  After that, use it
 * exactly as you would use ResourceBundle.
