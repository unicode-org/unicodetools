When you start to use the data for Radicals and Strokes in IDS, you run up against some problem cases. 
I propose that we augment the data for these to make them more useful, and use the data to update NamesList.txt and the UCA data.

Problems

 * The CJKRadicals.txt file doesn't cover all of the Radicals.
 * Some of that information is in the NamesList and UCA, but not in an easily machine-readable form.
 * The UCA and NamesList mappings are incomplete for the CJK Radicals, based on CJKRadicals.txt 
 * Moreover, CJKRadicals.txt does not provide stroke data.
 * The CJKRadicals.txt file is also in a somewhat awkward format. Unlike other UCD files, the source character is not the first field. 

Analysis

The attached data file is an attempt to flesh out the missing data, using some processing from multiple sources.

For example:

2F03;	1;	4;	4E3F	# (⼃ => 丿)	KANGXI RADICAL SLASH;	CJKRadicals.txt, NFKC
#?  	1;	4;	4E40	# (? => 乀)	?;	kRSUnicode
#?  	1;	4;	4E41	# (? => 乁)	?;	kRSUnicode

For the data lines, the following fields are used:
 Field 0: the source code point (radical)
 Field 2: the number of strokes in F0. This is obtained by looking up total strokes of the target Unified Ideograph (F3)
 Field 1: the radical number (with '). This is obtained from CJKRadicals.txt where possible, 
          and otherwise from #http://www.wikiwand.com/de/Unicodeblock_CJK-Radikale,_Erg%C3%A4nzung
 Field 3: the target Unified Ideograph. This is obtained from various "causes", listed in the comments after ';'
          CJKRadicals.txt
          NFKC
          UCA
          NamesList
          kRSUnicode
          kRSAdobe - according to kRSAdobe, the Unified Ideograph has the radical from F1, and zero remaining strokes
 Comment: (source => target) name ; causes
 
The kRSUnicode and kRSAdobe data are used to get a target Unified Ideograph by searching for those with a radical, and zero remaining strokes.
In such cases, the Unified Ideograph represents the radical alone. 
 
In the case of the last two (kRSUnicode, kRSAdobe), the source character (F1) has not been selected from the available
radicals (pending agreement by experts); instead the line is commented with ? for the source code point and its name.

For example:

2FC6;	11;	199;	9EA5	# (⿆ => 麥)	KANGXI RADICAL WHEAT;	CJKRadicals.txt, NFKC
#?  	7;	199;	9EA6	# (? => 麦)	?;	kRSAdobe

2EE8;	7;	199';	9EA6	# (⻨ => 麦)	CJK RADICAL SIMPLIFIED WHEAT;	CJKRadicals.txt, UCA, NamesList

The target based on the kRSAdobe is identical to that for 199', and the line should probably just be removed.

There is one outlier among the radicals, one that doesn't have a target Unified Ideograph
 
2E80;	0;	7;		# (⺀ => )	CJK RADICAL REPEAT;

There are some cases where the "main" mapping data appears like it is suboptimal, at least based on my fonts.
For example, it appears that the best target Unified Ideograph for CJK RADICAL FOOT would be 𧾷 (27FB7), not 足 (8DB3).

2F9C;	7;	157;	8DB3	# (⾜ => 足)	KANGXI RADICAL FOOT;	CJKRadicals.txt, NFKC
2ECA;	7;	157;	8DB3	# (⻊ => 足)	CJK RADICAL FOOT;	NamesList
#?  	7;	157;	27FB7	# (? => 𧾷)	?;	kRSUnicode

Experts should review this.

The NamesList mapping appears to be in in error; the better mapping would be to 27FB7 
(that may not have existed at the time the NameList information was composed)


Once we have a complete list for all of the Radicals, I would like to see us make it available in machine-readable form, 
and update the data in the NamesList and UCA.

It would also be useful to supply the same sort of information, where possible for the CJK Stroke characters. From n3063,
we have the following information. We should be able to use this data and the IDS data to provide a stroke count and
in some cases a target Unified Ideograph character, in the same format.
