<p>This set of charts shows the Unicode Collation Algorithm values for Unicode 
characters. The characters are arranged in the following groups:</p>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4">
  <tr>
    <th align="left"><i>Null</i></th>
    <th class="x">Completely ignoreable (primary, secondary and tertiary levels)<br>
      These include control codes and various formatting codes.</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th align="left"><i>Ignorable</i></th>
    <th class="x">Ignorable at a primary level, but not at a secondary or 
      tertiary level.<br>
      These include most accents and diacritics.</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th align="left"><i>Variable</i></th>
    <th class="x">Characters that may be set to ignorable by a programmatic 
      switch.<br>
      These include spaces, punctuation marks, and most symbols.</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th align="left"><i>Common</i></th>
    <th class="x">Characters that are none of the above, but not considered 
      letters.<br>
      These include numbers, currency symbols, etc.</th>
  <tr>
    <th align="left"><i>Letters</i></th>
    <th class="x">According to script</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th align="left"><i>Unsupported</i></th>
    <th class="x">Not explicitly supported in this version of UCA; uses 
      code-point order</th>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The characters* within each group are arranged in cells.
The characters added in the last release are in yellow.
Otherwise, the color of the 
cell indicates the strength of the difference between that character and the <i>previous</i> 
character in the chart, as follows.</p>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4">
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2"><font size="3"><u>No Expansion</u></font>
    <th rowspan="5">&nbsp;
    <th colspan="2"><font size="3"><u>Expansion</u></font>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="p">a<br>
      <tt>0061</tt></td>
    <th class="x">Primary difference
    <td class="ep">ǳ<br>

    <th class="x">Primary difference</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>

  <tr>

      or no difference</th>
  </tr>

  <p align="left"><b>Note: </b>If tooltips are enabled in your browser, then if 
  you pause the mouse over any cell, you will see the name of the character and 
  a representation of the sort key. In this representation, the separators 
  between the weight levels are represented with &quot;|&quot;.</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>*</th>
    <th class="x">In some cases, the UCA data table also includes contractions.<br>
      They can be recognized by the multiple code point numbers, as in the

<h3><b>Notes</b></h3>
<ul>
  <li>The UCA results are versioned <i>both</i> by the version of the UCA <i>and</i> 
    by the version of The Unicode Standard used to process the data.</li>
  <li>These charts only provide one of the alternatives for handling variable 
    characters (punctuation), whereby these characters are <b>non-ignorable.</b></li>
  <li>Characters from large blocks, such as CJK-Ideographs, Hangul Syllables, 
    Private Use Area, etc. are represented by a sampling.</li>
  <li>Some unassigned code points, noncharacters and other edge cases are also 
    added to the list for comparison.</li>
  <li>For more information, see <a href="https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr10/" target="_top">UTS 
    #10: Unicode Collation Algorithm</a>.</li>
</ul>
    <p><i>To properly view these charts, you need to have an updated browser,
      and Unicode fonts
      (such as the <a href="https://www.google.com/get/noto/" target="_blank">Noto Fonts</a>)
      that cover the characters you are interested in</i>.</p>
