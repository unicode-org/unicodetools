#
# This file contains aliases for property values used in the UCD.
# These names can be used for XML formats of UCD data, for regular-expression
# property tests, and other programmatic textual descriptions of Unicode data.
#
# The names may be translated in appropriate environments, and additional
# aliases may be useful.
#
# FORMAT
#
# Each line describes a property value name.
# This consists of three or more fields, separated by semicolons.
#
# First Field: The first field describes the property for which that
# property value name is used.
#
# Second Field: The second field is the short name for the property value.
# It is typically an abbreviation, but in a number of cases it is simply
# a duplicate of the "long name" in the third field.
#
# Third Field: The third field is the long name for the property value, 
# typically the formal name used in documentation about the property value.
#
# In the case of Canonical_Combining_Class (ccc), there are 4 fields: 
# The second field is numeric, the third is the short name, and the fourth is the long name.
#
# The above are the preferred aliases. Other aliases may be listed in additional fields.
#
# Loose matching should be applied to all property names and property values, with
# the exception of String Property values. With loose matching of property names and
# values, the case distinctions, whitespace, hyphens, and '_' are ignored.
# For Numeric Property values, numeric equivalence is applied: thus "01.00"
# is equivalent to "1".
#
# NOTE: Property value names are NOT unique across properties. For example:
#
#   AL means Arabic Letter for the Bidi_Class property, and
#   AL means Above_Left for the Canonical_Combining_Class property, and
#   AL means Alphabetic for the Line_Break property.
#
# In addition, some property names may be the same as some property value names.
# For example:
#
#   sc means the Script property, and
#   Sc means the General_Category property value Currency_Symbol (Sc)
#
# The combination of property value and property name is, however, unique.
#

# UTS #18, Unicode Regular Expressions.
