# Property comparison tests

Files in this directory are named after [RMG](https://github.com/unicode-org/utc-release-management)
pipeline issues.
Each file contains the tests comparing the properties of proposed characters to properties of
pre-existing characters, developed as part of PAG review.

Property comparison tests were not in place when properties were initially assigned for the 16.0
reÃÅpertoire; some have been retroactively created.  Comments in those files note feedback on errors
that would have been caught by the tests.
