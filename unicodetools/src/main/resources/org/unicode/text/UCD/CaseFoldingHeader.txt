# Case Folding Properties
#
# This file is a supplement to the UnicodeData file.
# It provides a case folding mapping generated from the Unicode Character Database.
# If all characters are mapped according to the full mapping below, then
# case differences (according to UnicodeData.txt and SpecialCasing.txt)
# are eliminated.
#
# The data supports both implementations that require simple case foldings
# (where string lengths don't change), and implementations that allow full case folding
# (where string lengths may grow). Note that where they can be supported, the
# full case foldings are superior: for example, they allow "MASSE" and "Ma√üe" to match.
#
# All code points not listed in this file map to themselves.
#
# NOTE: case folding does not preserve normalization formats!
#
# For information on case folding, including how to have case folding
# preserve normalization formats, see Section 3.13 Default Case Algorithms in
# The Unicode Standard.

# Format
# ================================================================================
# The entries in this file are in the following machine-readable format:
#
# <code>; <status>; <mapping>; # <name>
#
# The status field is:
# C: common case folding, common mappings shared by both simple and full mappings.
# F: full case folding, mappings that cause strings to grow in length. Multiple characters are separated by spaces.
# S: simple case folding, mappings to single characters where different from F.
# T: special case for uppercase I and dotted uppercase I
#    - For non-Turkic languages, this mapping is normally not used.
#    - For Turkic languages (tr, az), this mapping can be used instead of the normal mapping for these characters.
#      Note that the Turkic mappings do not maintain canonical equivalence without additional processing.
#      See the discussions of case mapping in the Unicode Standard for more information.
#
# Usage:
#  A. To do a simple case folding, use the mappings with status C + S.
#  B. To do a full case folding, use the mappings with status C + F.
#
#    The mappings with status T can be used or omitted depending on the desired case-folding
#    behavior. (The default option is to exclude them.)
#
# =================================================================

# Property: Case_Folding

#  All code points not explicitly listed for Case_Folding
#  have the value C for the status field, and the code point itself for the mapping field.
