	<h1>KEY:count</h1>
	<h1>Key</h1>
	<p>The columns provide counts according to the main categories in <a target='ordering' href='emoji-ordering.html'>Emoji Ordering</a>: Smileys &amp; People,	Animals &amp; Nature,	Food &amp; Drink</span>, and so on.</p>
    <p>The rows provide counts based on the internal structure or purpose of the emoji, as follows:</p>
    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th>Term</th>
          <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>char</th>
          <td>Emoji that are represented by single characters (or single characters plus the Emoji Presentation Selector, where necessary).</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>zwj</th>
          <td>An emoji  sequence that uses a special ZWJ character to  “glue” multiple emoji characters into a single emoji.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>skin</th>
          <td>An emoji sequence that contains a skin-tone modifier</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>👨/👩obj</th>
          <td>An emoji sequence representing a profession or role, which is composed of a MAN, WOMAN, or ADULT plus an object for that role.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>👪</th>
          <td>An emoji sequence representing a group of people, such as a family emoji</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>other</th>
          <td>An emoji sequence not fitting the other categories</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>♂/♀</th>
          <td>An emoji sequence using male or female signs to indicate a specific gender appearance</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>hair</th>
          <td>An emoji sequence containing a hair component, to pick a given hair color or style</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>keycap seq</th>
          <td>An emoji keycap sequence, consisting of phone keys 0, 1, 2 ... #, *</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>flag seq</th>
          <td>An emoji flag sequence, consisting of a pair of regional indicators</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>tag seq</th>
          <td>An emoji tag sequence </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>typical dup</th>
          <td>An emoji character or sequence that should have a gender-neutral appearance, but is typically depicted as having a specific gender appearance.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th><b>component</b></th>
          <td>An isolated component, such as a skin tone modifier or hair component, not typically shown on emoji keyboards. This count does not include  other components that should never be shown on emoji keyboards, such as the isolated flag components.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th><b>Subtotal</b></th>
          <td>This is the total without the typical dups or components, so it is a better reflection of what people would see on emoji keyboards/palettes. The keyboards may also use mechanisms like “long press” to handle related emoji, further reducing the number of visible cells.</td>
        </tr>
