XML Representation of Unicode 16.0.0 UCD


© 2024 Unicode®, Inc.
For terms of use, see https://www.unicode.org/terms_of_use.html


This directory contains the representation in XML of Version 16.0.0 of
the UCD, using the schema defined by UAX #42: Unicode Character
Database in XML, at https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr42/

While every effort has been made to ensure consistency of the 
XML representation with the UCD files, there may be some errors;
the UCD files are authoritative.


There are six files, available in zip/jar format:
  - flat vs. grouped
  - no Unihan data vs. Unihan data only vs. complete UCD. 

The flat versions do not use the group mechanism. The grouped versions
use the group mechanism, with groups corresponding approximately to
the blocks (a few blocks have been subdivided).

The "no Unihan data" files do not contain the properties expressed only
in the Unihan database. The "Unihan data only" files contain only
the properties and code points expressed in the Unihan database.
The "complete UCD" files reflect the complete UCD data.
