XML Representation of Unicode 9.0.0 UCD


© 1991-2016 Unicode, Inc.
For terms of use, see http://www.unicode.org/terms_of_use.html


This directory contains the representation in XML of version 9.0.0 of
the UCD, using the schema defined by UAX 42, "Unicode Character
Database in XML".

While every effort has been made to ensure consistency of the 
XML representation with the UCD files, there may be some errors;
the UCD files are authoritative.


There are six files, available in zip/jar format; the size is that of
the archive:

                    flat         grouped

no Unihan data       848 KB          532 KB
Unihan data only   5,692 KB        5,696 KB
complete UCD       7,272 KB        6,232 KB

The flat versions do not use the group mechanism. The grouped versions
use the group mechanism, with groups corresponding approximately to
the blocks (a few blocks have been subdivided).

The "no Unihan data" files do not contain the properties expressed only
in the Unihan database. The "Unihan data only" files contain only
the properties and code points expressed in the Unihan database.
The "complete  UCD" files reflect the complete UCD data.
