This directory contains data files listing the 
IDNA2008_Category Property for versions 6.1.0 to 16.0.0 of
the Unicode Standard.
The listing matches the "IDNA Derived Property" as defined in RFC 5892.

Starting with Unicode 17.0.0, the IDNA2008_Category Property data is published in
https://www.unicode.org/Public/<version>/idna/Idna2008.txt

The data files for Version 7.0.0 through Version 15.1.0 were updated
on 2023-11-13 to fix a clerical error that had caused them to be
inconsistent with the source file (IdnaMappingTable.txt) for each of
those versions. The revised derivations now correctly indicate
that U+19DA has IDNA2008_Category=DISALLOWED for those versions.
