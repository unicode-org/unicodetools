This directory contains data files listing the 
IDNA2008_Category Property for all versions of
the Unicode Standard extending back to Version 6.1.0.

The data files for Version 7.0.0 through Version 15.1.0 were updated
on 2023-11-13 to fix a clerical error that had caused them to be
inconsistent with the source file (IdnaMappingTable.txt) for each of
those versions. The revised derivations now correctly indicate
that U+19DA has IDNA2008_Category=DISALLOWED for those versions.

The listing matches the "IDNA Derived Property" as
defined in RFC 5892.
