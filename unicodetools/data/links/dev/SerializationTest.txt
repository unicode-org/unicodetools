# Field 0: Pre-Path portion of URL
# Field 1: Path
# Field 2: Query
# Field 3: Fragment
# Field 4: Expected result
#
# The input is 4 separate fields, 0..3. It represents the internal form of a URL, pre-escaping.
# The result is an escaped string for output.
#
# The reason the input is represented as 4 different fields is that the algorithm applies different escaping
# to each piece. 
#
# Notes: 
# - The # character is represented by \x{23} when it is part of a field (instead of introducing a comment in the data file)
# - Leading and trailing spaces in a field are to be omitted, but interior spaces are retained
