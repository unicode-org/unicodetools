# HTML Charts

## Building

*   Run UCA/Main.java (yes, UCA, *not* UCD/Main.java), with the argument `charts`.
    *   The output will be in {Generated}/charts/*
*   Spot-check the files.
*   Pack the whole *contents* of the charts/ folder (not the charts/ folder itself) into a charts.zip file, and upload that somewhere for review and for Rick to post.

## Deploying to beta directory

*   Once they look ok, Rick posts the files to https://www.unicode.org/charts/beta/.
*   Spot check each of the beta directories. Remember to refresh the browser when
    viewing.
