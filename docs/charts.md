# HTML Charts

## Building

*   Run UCA/main.java, with the argument `charts`.
    *   Result will be in `/unicode-draft/charts/*`
*   Spot-check and check in.
*   Ask for review at: <http://unicode.org/draft/charts/index.html>
    *   :construction: **TODO**: Work with Mark on a URL where this is possible after the move to GitHub.
    *   Note: some of the files may not show right if the svn:mime-type isn't
        set to text/html. That doesn't affect the final copy below.

## Deploying to beta directory

*   Once they look ok, copy to ftp://unicode.org/htdocs/charts/beta/
*   Spot check each of the beta directories. Remember to refresh browser when
    viewing.
