# properties - Unicode Properties and Values

[Demo](http://unicode.org/cldr/utility/properties.jsp)

This page shows the names of the Unicode character properties and some extended
properties. It also lets you see the values of a given property.

*   Hovering over a property will show the short name.
*   Clicking Show Values will show the values (or a selection, if there are too
    many).
*   Clicking on a value will show the
    [unicode-set](http://unicode.org/cldr/utility/list-unicodeset.jsp) of
    characters with that value.
