# Generate Emoji

TODO flesh this out with the build details.

## Candidate Data

Open
[candidateData.txt](https://github.com/unicode-org/unicodetools/blob/main/unicodetools/org/unicode/tools/emoji/candidateData.txt),
and update to current status from the UTC.

*   Status=Final Candidate, Draft Candidate, or Provisional Candidate
    *   It affects all following characters.
    *   So when as set moves from Provisional to Draft, the Status needs to be
        changed.
*   Quarter, Proposal, and After are **prefix**, and affect *all* characters up
    to when changed.
*   Then comes the code point
    *   Provisional names have a 6 digit code, which is
        10<2digit-year><2digits>, like 101956
        *   The 2digit-year is the year it is targeted for.
        *   The 2digits are assigned sequentially, but ordering doesn't matter
    *   Draft codes are regular Unicode codes (assigned by UTC)
    *   The code is used to fetch the image from:
        *   {workspace}/unicode-draft/reports/tr51/images/proposed/
        *   like: proposed_101956.png
*   Then specific modifiers like:
    *   Name=red-haired person
    *   Keywords= ginger | redhead
    *   Emoji_Modifier_Base
    *   Emoji_Gender_Base
*   The names can be in any case (they are lowercased)
*   The keywords should be in the final case (allowing uppercase like Jolly
    Roger)
*   The gender and modifier variants are generated automatically
    *   The modifier variants are generated according to the emoji properties
    *   The gender variants are generated according to
        EmojiData.getGenderBases()

Example:
```
Proposal=L2/17-082, L2/17-011, L2/16-147, L2/16130, L2/16-008, L2/14-173

After=üëÉüèø



U+1F9B0

Name=red-haired

UName=EMOJI COMPONENT RED HAIR

Keywords= ginger | redhead

Emoji_Component

Comment=Component for use in <a target='doc' href='http://unicode.org/reports/tr51/proposed.html#def_RGI'>RGI</a> sequences. Isolated images should have dotted borders.
```

Open GenerateEmoji.java and look at showCandidateStyle. Fix topHeader (right
instance) and getDoubleLink("Provisional Candidates") as necessary for new
status (eg changing Provisional to Draft).

Open tr51/images/proposed/ and copy in any missing images. Follow the
requirements on
[selection.html#images](https://www.unicode.org/emoji/selection.html#images).

## Running the tool

Run GenerateEmoji.java to regenerate all charts (including emoji-candidates).
Sanity check, fix, and iterate as necessary.

There are two environment variables (in Eclipse, you can create different
Configurations for these)
```
-Demoji-abbr => creates an abbreviated version
-Demoji-beta => creates a beta version (only necessary if producing both a current and past version
```

## Draft Candidates

Once a character is added to Draft candidates, then the draft data files have to
be updated as well. In particular, they need to be added to
/unicodetools/data/emoji/X.0:

1.  /source/emojiOrdering.txt
2.  /emoji-data.txt
    1.  The gender and skin-tone variants are generated automatically
3.  Move the proposal information from candidateData.text to proposalData.txt.
    Use `CandidateData.generateProposalData` to get the list, but verify
4.  ...

## Final Candidates

Moving from final candidates involves a number of changes.
